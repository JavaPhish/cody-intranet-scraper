<h1> Open Source Intranet Project Scraper </h1>


<h4> To Do: </h4>
	<li> Create an install file so it can finally be run like a command (IMPORTANT)</li>
	<li> Release it to students to get bug reports and feedback</li>
	<li> hopefully get others to contribute as open source</li>
	<li> Get a decent sleep schedule</li>
	<li> Possibly have it create the directory and insert the files (I might get to this one if i get a chance) </li>

<h4> Usage: </h4>
	Navigate to the directory for the project (Yes you have to make the directory cry me a river)
	Then, using the command "idkyet" type in the project number OR the project URL
	
	Example 1:
		call_name 243
	OR
	Example 2:
		call_name https://intranet.hbtn.io/projects/239
