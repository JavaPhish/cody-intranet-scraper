<h1> Cody : An Intranet Project Scraper </h1>
<h5>Want to help me improve this? Just ask to be a contributer and make your own branch :) </h5>

I DO NOT CREATE DIRECTORIES, OR PULL HEADER FILES!!!

<h4> Usage: </h4>
	First run the install scripts by using ./install.sh
	You must be root for it to work properly

	Now that everything's ready

	Navigate to the directory for the project (Yes you have to make the directory cry me a river)
	Then, using the command "cody" type in the project number OR the project URL
	
	Example 1:
		cody 243
	OR
	Example 2:
		cody https://intranet.hbtn.io/projects/239

	It will then automatically generate all project files along with all project main files
	that it can detect. WARNING: Its still in betaish so it does pull some odd files every now and then.
	It also does not pull header files or create the directory

<h4> Bugs: </h4>
	<li> When two project files exist for the same task, it will theoretically make one file
	with both of their names and consider it done. It should instead parse each file seperately</li>
	
<h4> To Do: </h4>
	<li> make it generate README </li>
	<li> Release it to students to get bug reports and feedback</li>
	<li> Get a decent sleep schedule</li>
	<li> Possibly have it create the directory and insert the files (I might get to this one if i get a chance) </li>


<h4> How it works </h4>
	Gimme a bit ill fill this in shortly
